# "Novedades" Store Management App - A Roadmap

This application aims to streamline inventory management and sales for "Novedades," a clothing store catering to college students. The app will offer functionalities for user management, product details, stock control, reporting, and more.

Here's a breakdown of the key features you described:

## User Management (CRUD):

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete user accounts.
- Implement a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to define user permissions (e.g., admin, staff, customer).

## Authentication (AUTH/UNAUTH):

- Secure user login and registration with features like password hashing.
- Differentiate access based on user roles (authorized/unauthorized).

## Product Management (CRUD):

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete product information (clothing items).
- Include details like size, price, description, and images.

## Pledge Management (CRUD):

- Manage "pledges" which could represent pre-orders or reservations.
- Track details like customer information, product selection, quantity, and status.

## Size Management (CRUD):

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete size options (e.g., S, M, L, etc.).

## Pledge-Size Association (CRUD):

- Link pledges to specific sizes for accurate reservation tracking.

## Building Management (CRUD):

- Manage physical locations (buildings) where stock is stored.

## Stock Management (CRUD by Buildings):

- Track inventory levels for each product size across different buildings.
- Update stock levels based on sales, returns, and transfers.

## Reporting:

- Generate reports for various aspects like:
  - **Sales:** Total sales, sales per product, sales by building, etc.
  - **Inventory:** Stock levels, low stock alerts, product movement reports.
  - **Earnings and Expenses:** Track financial performance.
  - **Most/Least Sold Products:** Identify trends and adjust inventory accordingly.
  - **Each CRUD Operation:** Generate reports on specific user actions (e.g., user creation reports, product update reports).

## Utilities:

- Implement functionalities to assist with daily operations (e.g., data import/export, barcode scanning for products).

## Additional Considerations:

- **Security:** Prioritize data security with measures like user authentication, data encryption, and regular backups.
- **User Interface (UI):** Design a user-friendly interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate for users with different roles.
- **Scalability:** Consider future growth and ensure the app can accommodate an increasing number of users and products.

## Developers:

- Daniel Bautista ([Daniel Bautista](https://github.com/daniel-baf)) - This application concept is created by Daniel Bautista. You can find more about him on his Github profile.

## Next Steps:

1. **Development Approach:** Decide whether to build the app from scratch, use a low-code platform, or leverage existing e-commerce solutions with customization.
2. **Prioritization:** Rank features based on importance and development timeline.
3. **Prototype Development:** Develop a basic prototype to test functionality and user experience.

By implementing this app, "Novedades" can expect improved inventory management, efficient sales tracking, valuable data insights, and a user-friendly platform to manage their college clothing business.
